=== BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ===

The git repository uses git submodules to handle libqtpf dependency, therefore
you should use following steps to clone repository and submodules repositories:

git clone git://github.com/g76r/qron.git
cd qron
git submodule init
git submodule update

Then one should build libqtpf before qron since it's a dependency.
This can be done with the top directory qmake project or with any external
programm such as an IDE like Qt Creator.
